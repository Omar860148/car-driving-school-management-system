# car-driving-school-management-system
The Car Driving School Management System Project displays dynamic data or information in the Public Website Side. Each data can be only updated or managed by the management at the Admin Panel. Visitors of possible students can read the welcome and about content on the website, list all training packages that the school provides, and enroll. The Admin Panel can be accessed by 2 types of user roles which are the Administrators and Staff. The Administrators are the ones who can access and manage all the features and functionalities that the system has while Staff users have only limited permission on the said side of the system. The application can also generate printable enrollee's details and printable date-wise payment reports.
